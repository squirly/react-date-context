## Background

Rendering and updating React components that depend on the real time is hard. 
Testing React component trees that use `new Date()` directly is even more
difficult.

## Install

This project can be installed using [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out
if you don't have them locally installed.

```sh
$ npm install react-date-context
```

## Usage

This package contains three React components.

### `<RealDate>`

### `<StaticDate>`

### `<CurrentDate>`
